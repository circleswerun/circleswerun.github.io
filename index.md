## Hey There, Welcome To My Page. 

For those of you who don't know me - I'm CirclesWeRun, AKA Circles, AKA Kyle.  Currently, I work full time as an Executive Cybersecurity Consultant while also pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.  

One of my best traits, and sometimes my worst, is the ability to view things from various perspectives.  Some see a glass half full, some half empty, well... why not both?  When it comes to technology, I almost always ignore the intended purpose and develop my own potential use cases.  Thinking this way has shown me that with enough creativity and a little bit of time, anything can be hacked.
